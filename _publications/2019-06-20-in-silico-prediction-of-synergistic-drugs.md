excerpt: 'We presented our method for DREAM AstraZeneca-Sanger Drug Combination Prediction Challenge to predict synergistic drug combinations.

In this paper, we show that our machine learning model obtained the primary metric = 0.36 and the tie-breaker metric = 0.37 in the extension round of the challenge which was ranked in top 15 out of 76 submissions. In addition, we analyzed our model’s predictions to better understand the molecular processes underlying synergy and discovered that key regulators of tumorigenesis such as TNFA and BRAF are often targets in synergistic interactions, while MYC is often duplicated. We ultimately presented novel hypotheses for synergistic drug pairs and their mechanisms that are supported by both computational predictions and biological understanding.
