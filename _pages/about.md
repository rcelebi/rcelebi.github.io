Welcome to my personal web page
======

I am Assistant Professor at [Institute of Data Science at Maastricht University](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/research/institute-data-science). My research interests include Knowledge Graphs, Linked Open Data,  Machine Learning, and Semantic Web Technologies. I have gained  considerable experience in data integration and knowledge discovery from structured and unstructured data.
My research vision is to understand and improve personalized health and accelerate drug discovery through use of responsible AI approaches and adhering to the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) principles.

I am interested in developing neuro-symbolic models using knowledge graphs and embedding representation and integrating heterogeneous data into unified knowledge graphs and developing machine learning for personalized health and drug discovery.
